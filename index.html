    <h1>Privacy Policy for Treadify</h1>
    
    <p class="last-updated"><strong>Last Updated:</strong> January 08, 2026</p>
    
    <p>The developer of the Treadify application, Eldar Gashimov (an individual), respects your privacy. This policy explains how your information is handled.</p>
    
    <h2>1. Data Collection and Use</h2>
    <p>The Treadify application <strong>does not collect, store, or transmit any of your personal data or usage data (analytics)</strong>. All information you enter into the application (e.g., habit names and progress) is stored exclusively in your device's memory (locally) and is not sent anywhere.</p>
    
    <h2>2. No Third-Party Access</h2>
    <p>Since data never leaves your device, it cannot be shared, sold, or otherwise processed by third parties, including the developer.</p>
    
    <h2>3. Security</h2>
    <p>The security of your data stored on the device depends on the protection measures provided by your operating system (iOS). It is recommended to use standard device security features (password, Face ID, Touch ID).</p>
    
    <h2>4. Data Deletion</h2>
    <p>You can delete your data in two ways:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Partial Deletion</strong>: Go to the progress screen of any habit and delete its information. This action will permanently erase the data associated with that specific habit.</li>
        <li><strong>Complete Deletion</strong>: All application data can be completely and permanently deleted by removing the Treadify application from your device.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>5. Children's Policy</h2>
    <p>The application is not specifically aimed at children; however, due to the absence of data collection, it does not impose age restrictions for use.</p>
    
    <h2>6. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>If features requiring data collection are added to the application in the future, this privacy policy will be updated. The current version will always be available on this page.</p>
    
    <h2>7. Contact Us</h2>
    <div class="contact-email">
        <p>If you have any questions about this privacy policy, you can contact the developer at:</p>
